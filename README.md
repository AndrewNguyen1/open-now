# OpenNow
Charlottesville and Albemarle County's premier site for exploring small businesses in the post-COVID era.

## What is OpenNow?

OpenNow is a platform for community members in the Charlottesville and Albemarle County area - including University of Virginia students, faculty, and staff - to explore local small businesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Users can view businesses, submit reviews for businesses, crowdsource their business hours, and submit their own business entries to OpenNow. Additionally, users can connect with other community members and share their experiences via the OpenNow forums. OpenNow is largely a crowdsourcing experiment to benefit the businesses that contribute so much to the Charlottesville area.

OpenNow was originally created in Spring 2021 as a course project for the [Advanced Software Development Methods (CS 3240) course](https://cs3240.cs.virginia.edu/) at the University of Virginia. This project falls under _Project Option 3: What's Changed?_
